# planning-with-files: resolve the active plan, verify its attestation, and emit
# plan context for injection into the model turn.
#
# This script holds the logic that used to live inline in the UserPromptSubmit,
# PreToolUse, and PreCompact hook command scalars (v2.43 and earlier). The hooks
# now dispatch to this file via the proven self-discovery pattern, so the logic
# is versioned and testable instead of duplicated across 14 SKILL.md variants.
#
# Context modes (--context=...):
#   userprompt (default) — full plan head + progress/ledger summary. Once per turn.
#   pretool              — short plan head only (head -30), no progress.
#   precompact           — compaction reminder only (no plan body), matches v2.
#
# v3 behavior keys off explicit opt-in. With no .mode file present the output is
# byte-equivalent to the v2.43 hook scalars (legacy invariant). Autonomous and
# gated modes change the injection shape (full fidelity + structured ledger
# summary instead of raw progress.md tail; per-tool-call injection dropped).
#
# Multi-root disambiguation (issue #212): PWF_PLAN_ROOT pins the effective plan
# root for threads whose cwd is a shared parent of the real project; a
# .planning/sessions dir arms the same session-attachment guard the Codex
# adapter enforces; and an ambiguous cwd-guessed resolution refuses to inject
# when a direct child of the root carries its own competing .planning.
#
# Always exits 0. Never errors out the agent loop.
